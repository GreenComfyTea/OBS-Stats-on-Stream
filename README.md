# How to use
1. Download the script.
2. Add a text source to your scene. This source will be used to display the data.
3. Open Tools -> Scripts. Add the script.
4. Configure the script.
    * Output Mode must match the OBS encoder mode. Check it by going OBS -> Settings -> Output -> Output Mode (on the very top).
    * Update Delay determines how often the data will be updated. 1000 ms means once a second. 100 ms means 10 times a second.
    * Choose the name of your created text source.
    * Check and/or uncheck what you want to display.
5. You are ready to go!

# TODO
* Add bitrate.
* Add framerate.
* Add feature to print the data in chat triggered by a command !obsstats.
